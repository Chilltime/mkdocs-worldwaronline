Capital Warfare was a feature introduced in Season 3 of 2017, and was transformed into **Squad Wars** in Season 3 of 2020. For 72 Hours 3 Squads participate in epic battles conquering Capital Bases. Each Capital Base rewards a certain number of points depending on the period of the Season.

## How it works

The [Squad Leaderboard](leaderboard-squad.md) is composed of Squads that are currently competing by participating in Squad Wars, and conquering Capital Bases to gain points.

Each Squad starts out as Unranked and once they get their first points, they immediately placed in the Leaderboard.

Every week, the top 2 Squads are promoted to the League above, and at the same time, the bottom 2 Squads are demoted to the League below. The promoted and demoted squads will be at the bottom/top of their new League respectively. At the end of the Season, the top 5 Squads host their respective country's flags in the podium.

## Squad Matchmaking

### Squad War Matchup

-   Each squad will be faced against 2 other squads.
-   **Squad War matchups are based on the Squad Leaderboard positions**. Squads will be matched within an enemy squad **until 6 positions below them**. Since allied Squads will never be matched up against each other, places on the leaderboard might be skipped, leading a squad to face ather that is lower than 6 positions below.

### Player matchups in each Squad War matchup

-   Each Squad War matchup will put 2 players from each squad controlling 1 of 4 bases.
-   Each duel has 4 bases, 2 bases in the capital of each squad. A total of 12 bases on 3 Squad Wars, 6 in your capital and 6 in capitals of other squads.
-   Leaderboard points are awarded each hour to the Squad of the players controlling the bases.
-   **Squads with less than 4 players are not selected for matchmaking.** If youâ€™re looking to recruit more squad mates, have a look at the [Squad Recruitment Tools](https://guides.worldwaronline.com/blog/squad_recruitment/) topic.

The Player Matchups work as shown in the following image. This will allow you to play together with teammates in a collaborative way, whilst keeping each matchup competitive and fun.

## Attack Rules

-   You can support your squad mates with units in attack and defense. Working as a team with support units will give you a significant advantage.
-   Players can target the enemy player they are matched with both in their base and their army.
-   You need to move units to the capital district attributed to you in the matchups, in order to defend and attack your enemy.
-   **You can't attack players on capital districts that were not attributed to you** in Squad and Player Matchups.
-   You can attack the armies of your Allies' enemies on the Capital Bases that your Ally is contesting.

## Points

-   **Points are earned every hour.** Example 9:00, 10:00 (etc), so make sure to control the capital base at that time!
-   **Player Leaderboard Points** are earned based on the league of your Squad (8 points Gold, 4 points Silver, 2 points Bronze, 1 point White).
-   **Point progression:** points value 2x more in the last 5 weeks of the Season and 3x more in the final week.
