Whenever there is a Battle, all participating players get a Battle Report. A <a href="https://www.worldwaronline.com/battle" target="_blank"> **Battle Report** </a> informs players of the course and outcome of a Battle.

## Battle Results

There are two possible outcomes to a fight: Victory and Defeat. Within them, there are two levels; Decisive Results and Close Results:

- A Decisive Result takes place when one of the sides was completely destroyed;
- A Close Result takes place when the Battle reaches 50 waves and both sides still had active units in the Battlefield. In a Close Result, the Winning Factor makes it so that the side with the highest percentage of units alive wins, regardless of the unit type.

You can also play a video of the battle to see how units were destroyed, what were the enemy's strategies and learn from this to preare for the next battles.
