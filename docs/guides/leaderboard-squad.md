The Squad Leaderboard is composed of the Squads that are currently competing by participating in
Squad Wars against other Squads and conquering Capital Bases to get points. Each Squad starts out as
Unranked and once they get their first points, they immediately get placed in the Leaderboard. With
enough points, Squads get promoted to the Silver and Gold League, where finally at the end of the
Season, the top 5 Squads host their respective country's flags in the podium.

## Leagues

There are 4 Leagues in World War Online, and at the end of the Season, players from squads in
different leagues receive varied rewards based on their Ranking. Squads are ranked based on the
number of Points they have, and in each League there's a maximum number of squads:

## League Squad Limit
