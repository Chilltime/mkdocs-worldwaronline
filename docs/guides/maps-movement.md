![Map](images/header_map.webp "World War Online Map")

## Map

The Map is divided into 3 main views:

-   **The Continent View**, which will give you a general view of the continent you are currently
    in, as well as its Districts and Capitals;
-   **The District View**, which will show you the Bases and Armies stationed inside the District
    you are in;
-   **The Base View**, which will give you access to the Base's actions, like upgrading the Base or
    Training Units if it's your Base or sending an attack if it belongs to an enemy.

## District

Districts are small sectors that each Continent is separated into and it's where players can find
Bases. There are 3 main types of Districts:

### 1. Guerrilla

These compose the majority of the World Map. You can produce or move in all types of Air and Land
units here.

### 2. Coastal

These are also Guerilla districts, but are located next to a bed of water. Players can use these
Districts to produce Navy Units.

### 3. Capital

Country Capitals are only accessible to players within a Squad participating in Squad Wars. They
have a fixed amount of Bases. If you're a member of a Squad, you can attack and conquer these Bases
to earn points in the Leaderboard through Squad Wars.

## Actions Available in Districts

## Movement

![Moving in the map](images/map_movement.webp "Map Movements")

To get around in the world, players need to understand movement. There are 2 ways that players can
move around the map:

-   **Clicking on the Unit Flag:** This will allow you to click on Move and drag the cursor to
    wherever you want on the map. Clicking on another continent will allow you to move those units
    to another continent.
-   **Clicking on any district** will have the “Move” button on the top right corner in the District
    Sidebar. This will show all units that are available to be moved in that continent. You can also
    select different continents from the top menu when moving to a district.

Movement takes time, but you do have the option to accelerate unit movements via
[WWO-Influence](resources.md). The cost to accelerate unit movements are determined by each given
distance.
