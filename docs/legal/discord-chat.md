Moderators can mute or ban users who do not follow the rules depending on the severity of their

-   **Be cool, kind and civil.** Treat all members with respect and express your thoughts in a
    constructive manner.

-   **Do not be disrespectful, hurtful, insulting, or rude to the channel members and admins under
    any circumstances.** Insulting, harassing, belittling, or putting others down will not be
    tolerated. This also includes “naming and shaming” any member of the World War Online Community

    of a sexual nature, hate speech, illegal (or controlled) drugs/substances, or any illegal
    activity.

-   **No inappropriate profiles** (usernames, nicknames, avatars, linked accounts, playing or custom
    status). Avoid special characters, emoji, obscenities, and impersonation. Your name should be
    easily taggable.
