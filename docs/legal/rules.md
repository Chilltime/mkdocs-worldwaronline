# Game Rules

Here you can find some ground rules for World War Online!

The account is non-transferable and exclusively associated to only one login service. Each player
holds reponsibility to maintaining their login service.

### 1.1. Avatar Image and Codename

-   Don't use your avatar and/or codename to protest against other players, countries or the game;
-   Don't use your avatar and/or codename to report bugs or situations in the game, use the
    [Contact Form](https://www.worldwaronline.com/t/support_guides);

    impersonation and/or any controversial or offensive content, which includes (but it is not
    limited to) racism, religion, politics, real-world violence, terrorism, content of a sexual
    nature, and hate speech.

By uploading a file you certify that you have the right to distribute this picture and that it does

## 2. Bots, scripts and access

The game must be played on an unmodified internet browser. It is forbidden to use any bots, scripts,
page reloaders or macros to automate actions. It is also forbidden to use foreign proxies and VPN
connections to access the game in other countries or use other forms of concealing your identity.

It's also forbidden to share any IP connection with more than 1 player, on certain exceptions,
including but not limited to:

-   Being in a public location (schools, universities, cafes);
-   Sharing the same house.

Proof of these excepetions may be required and, if not provided, can lead to suspension and
permanent ban from the game.

Bugs and errors may not be exploited by players. If a bug is found, the player must report it
immediately using our [Contact Form](https://www.worldwaronline.com/t/support_guides).

## 4. Fake Accounts

Creating fake accounts for the sake of spying any other country is strictly forbidden. Providing
military or strategic information to foreign countries is also forbidden, this includes giving

trade of WWO-Influence. WWO-Influence is not transferable between accounts belonging to different
players. If you purchase WWO-Influence you agree to our [Store Rules](store-rules.md).

You are also forbidden to share a purchasing account with other players, as it violates our Store
Rules.

## 6. Punishment

Breaking any of these rules can result in a reset or ban of any accounts involved. Punishments will
always exceed the gain of violating the rules. Resources, bases and units lost during suspension
will not be returned.

No player has the right to claim payment for WWO-Influence lost due to suspension. There is no
special treatment for WWO-Influence users regarding game rules neither in the time we take to deal
with the case nor the actions taken. Players that have been suspended can contact World War Online

    players, if there is a mutual understanding.
