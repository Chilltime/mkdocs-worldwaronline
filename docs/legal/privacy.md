# Privacy Policy

Welcome to World War Online, a product operated by Chilltime Lda. (“Chilltime”). This Privacy Policy
explains how information about you is collected, used and disclosed by Chilltime Lda and our
affiliates (“Chilltime”, “we” or “us”). We use the terms “member”, “you” and “your” to mean any
person using our Platform or any applications created by Chilltime and available through networking
sites (“SNS App”), any software running on Chilltime’s servers, (“Chilltime Software”), content,
related documentation, information on the Chilltime domain, and information made available by users
to each other through the Chilltime Software (collectively the “Service”).

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use and, in certain
circumstances, share your personally identifying information. Please read this Privacy Policy
carefully before using our Service, and if you have any questions, feel free to contact us.

## 1. Collection of Information and Personal Data

Personal data in this sense refers to all individual pieces of information regarding the personal or
material circumstances of an identified or identifiable natural person, such as name, address, or
email address as well as IP address. If you visit our Game or use the Contact Form, the collection,
processing, and use of personal data will take place.

We collect information about you when:

-   You provide some of it directly (such as by registering for an account).
-   We record some of it automatically (including with technologies like cookies).
-   We receive some of it from third parties (social media companies).

We also collect information, such as usage statistics, by using cookies, server logs, and similar
technologies. The particular kinds of information we gather are dependent on how you interact with
World War Online.

### 1.1. Information you provide to us

We collect information you choose to provide or give to us in any manner. For example, we collect

-   Your messages to the Service (such as chat logs and customer support tickets);
-   Your name, payment method, and other details we collect to help process purchases you make;

World War Online also offers social features like forums and chat. When you use these features, the
information you share is public information – this means we may collect and use the information you
provide, and in some cases it may also be collected or used by others without your knowledge.

In addition to information about yourself, you may choose to share information about yourself in
other content ("Content"), such as in products. Any action you perform with other users are
considered public, and at your own discretion.

When you use a product with social network features like ours, note that some information will be
publicly accessible to others, such as your game statistics and performance. We may record gameplay
and related information (such as Username, Military Rank, and in-game actions), and replay or
otherwise make it available to other users without further notice to you.

### 1.2. Information we collect automatically

-   Data about your account and game progress;
-   Your IP address and mobile device identifiers (such as your device ID, advertising ID, MAC
    address, IMEI);
-   Data about your device, such as device name and operating system, browser type and language;
-   Data we collect with cookies and similar technologies (see more below);
-   General location data;
-   Data about your use of the Service, such as gameplay data and your interactions with other
    players inside the Service.

### 1.3. Information We Collect From Third Parties

-   Data we receive if you link a third party tool with the Service (such as Facebook or Google);
-   Demographic data (such as to determine the coarse location of your IP address);
-   Data to fight fraud (such as refund abuse in games or click fraud in advertising);
-   Data from platforms that the games run on (such as to verify payment);
-   Data for advertising and analytics purposes, so we can provide you a better Service.

## 2. How We Collect Information

### 2.1. Cookies & Related Technologies

World War Online may contain links to other websites. We are of course not responsible for the
privacy practices of other websites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site to
read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable
information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by World War Online. You
can know more about this in our [Cookie Policy](cookies.md).

### 2.2. Analytics & Third Party Advertising Companies

In order to provide the best possible service and to allow us to make certain internal reports and
make recommendations, we collect aggregate information about the use of World War Online, including
information about users accessing the Chilltime site or playing World War Online and other Chilltime
games or using SNS Apps on other sites, such as internet protocol addresses, browser type, browser
language, referring / exit pages and URLs, other browser history, platform type, number of clicks,
domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on
particular pages, and the date and time (“Activity Information”).

Chilltime does not provide any Personally Identifiable Information to third-party advertising
companies.

#### 2.2.1. Google Analytics

This website uses Google Analytics, a web analysis service of Google Inc. Google Analytics uses
so-called "Cookies", text files which are stored on your computer or smartphone and which allow an
analysis of the use of our website by you. The information generated by the Cookie about your use of

Also Google will transfer this information if necessary to third parties, provided that this legally
prescribed or as far as third parties process these data on behalf of Google. Google will associate
in no circumstances your IP address with the other data that are stored by Google.

By using World War Online, you agree with the treatment of the data upraised about you by Google in
the before described way and for the before named purpose. You can find more information about

### 3.3. Sharing Information

We do not share any kind of information about you, including but not limited to name, email address,
password, payment details, messages sent to us or others using our services, and all other data you
share with us or that we automatically collect.

Chilltime may disclose information about you to our partners in order to provide the Service,
resolve service problems and correct errors in the Service, to communicate with you about the
Service, to provide you with advertising and promotional information in connection with the Service,
and to enhance your experience on the Service. However, we do not give our partners an independent
right to share this information.

Due to our contractual obligations with these third parties and the need to share information to
deliver and support the Service, we cannot provide you with the opportunity to opt-out of sharing
information (whether Personally Identifiable Information or other information) with these third
parties. Chilltime, certain of its partners, and each of their contractors and employees may view
the Content that you transmit to the service to provide the Service and otherwise perform the tasks
set forth in this Privacy Policy.

### 3.4. Transfers of Information

By using the Chilltime services and World War Online, you acknowledge and agree that your
information may be processed outside your country of residence, including in other jurisdictions
(namely Portugal) that may have different data protection frameworks than your region.

We’ve implemented and maintain a framework consistent with applicable law and this policy for
transfers of information outside the country of collection. For example, when we transfer personal
data collected in the European Union to locations outside the European Economic Area, we rely on
transfer mechanisms adopted by the European Commission to help establish adequate safeguards, like
Standard Contractual Clauses. We may also need to transfer your information to provide the Chilltime
services to you in accordance with our existing agreements with you, such as the Terms of Service.

We also reserve the right to transfer your personal information in the event of a transfer of
ownership of Chilltime or the acquisition of substantially all the assets of Chilltime related to
the business which collected such information, such as acquisition by or merger with another
company. In such an event, Chilltime will notify users who have provided email addresses when
information about those users is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

### 3.5. Public Chat or Forums

We’ve empowered our users to help police compliance with our policies related to certain in-game
behavior. Our product users may report each other and submit descriptions of their in-game activity
and actions to help us determine if the reported behavior constituted a violation of rules and
procedures that apply to user conduct, as well as any potential repercussions (such as
[temporary or permanent account suspensions](reports-bans-suspensions.md) or chat restrictions).

We also record and store, and reserve the right (but have no obligation) to monitor chat and similar
details about in-game interactions for a period we determine in our sole discretion is appropriate
to help us, among other things, detect and prevent toxicity, enforce our rules and policies, and
foster a more positive gaming community for our users. We use both manual (like many user Support
tickets) and automated (such as machine learning) tools and techniques to support these efforts.

Please be kind to other users, observe our policies related to user behavior (including our
[Game Rules](rules.md) and [Terms of Use](tos.md)), and always be careful with what you share!

If you choose to use means outside of World War Online to communicate with us, such as social media
platforms, we recommend you check their respective Privacy Policies. Some examples:

-   **Facebook Messenger:** <https://www.messenger.com/privacy>
-   **Discord:** <https://discordapp.com/privacy>

## 4. Age Limits

We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal data about or direct or target interest based
advertising to anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to use our Services. If
you are under 13, please do not send any data about yourself to us, including your name, address,
telephone number, or email address. No one under the age of 13 may provide any personal data.

If we learn that we have collected personal data about a child under age 13, we will delete that
data as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any data from or about a child under
the age of 13, please contact us through
[support@worldwaronline.com](mailto:support@worldwaronline.com).

## 5. Security

The security, integrity, and confidentiality of your information are extremely important to us.

In order to help ensure a secure and safe player experience, we are continuously developing and

unauthorized access or against loss, misuse or alteration.

Chilltime takes appropriate precautions to protect users' information. Your account information is

Please be aware that, despite our best efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. We
will retain your personal information for the length of time needed to fulfill the purposes outlined
in this privacy policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.

### 5.1. Data Retention

We retain your data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you the Service.
We will for example periodically de-identify unused game accounts and we regularly review and
de-identify unnecessary data.

legitimate business interests, such as to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and
enforce our agreements.

You can review and change information about you or deactivate your account in your account settings,
but we may retain certain information. You may deactivate your account by editing your account

If you’re concerned with the way we’re handling your info, or would like to update or delete the
personal info associated with your Our product account, please [Contact Us](/support). Note that
asking us to remove personal info or refrain from processing it may also result in account
suspension or termination, in which case you’ll no longer be able to access many of the Chilltime
services. We may also retain certain information associated with your account for purposes like
complying with our legal obligations, managing internal books and records, preventing fraud,
resolving disputes, and enforcing our contracts and terms, such as this policy and the Terms of Use.
