## 4. User Content

The Service may invite you to chat or participate in blogs, message boards, online forums, and other
related features, and may provide you with the opportunity to create, submit, post, display,
transmit, perform, publish, distribute or broadcast content and materials to World War Online and/or
to or via the Service, including, without limitation, text, writings, photographs, graphics,
comments, suggestions or personally identifiable information or other material (collectively "User

services will be treated as non-confidential and non-proprietary.

You agree that your User Content is wholly original to you and you exclusively own the rights to
your User Content, including the right to grant all of the rights and licenses in these Terms
without Chilltime incurring any third party obligations or liability arising out of its exercise of
the rights thereto granted herein by you.

You grant to Chilltime the unrestricted, unconditional, unlimited, worldwide, irrevocable, perpetual
fully-paid and royalty-free right and license to host, use, copy, distribute, reproduce, disclose,
sell, resell, sublicense, display, perform, transmit, publish, broadcast, modify, make derivative
works from, retitle, reformat, translate, archive, store, cache or otherwise exploit in any manner

associated with your User Content, but Chilltime does have the right to enforce such rights through
any means it sees fit, including bringing and controlling actions on your behalf.

Chilltime has no obligation to accept, display, review, monitor, or maintain any User Content. We
have the right to delete User Content from the Service without notice for any reason at any time.
Chilltime may move, re-format, edit, alter, distort, remove or refuse to exploit User Content
without notice to you and without liability; provided, however, that Chilltime reserves the right to

editorial control except to enforce the rights of third parties and the Content Restrictions set
forth below when violations are brought to Chilltime's attention.

You acknowledge that you do not rely on Chilltime to monitor or edit the Game and that the Game may
contain content which you find offensive and you hereby waive any objections you might have with
respect to viewing such content.

## 5. Posting on Other Web Sites

You are granted a limited revocable license to post an image of your personal avatar and/or
screenshot from your account, within the Service and any other materials that Chilltime specifically
gives you notice may be posted on other web sites, on your own personal web site or on a third party
web site that permits posting of content at the direction of users provided that such third party
web site:

-   Is not commercially competitive to Chilltime
-   Does not criticize or injure Chilltime
-   Does not obtain any rights to such content other than a non-exclusive license to post it at your
    direction
-   Does not charge for access to such content or associated products, services or advertising with

    such site links, comply with all applicable laws and do not in any way abuse, defame, stalk,
    threaten or violate the rights of privacy, publicity, intellectual property or other legal
    rights of others or, in any way, post, publish, distribute, disseminate or facilitate any
    inappropriate, infringing, defamatory, profane, indecent, obscene, illegal/unlawful or otherwise
    objectionable information, topic, name or other material (an “Authorized Web Site”).

license, in whole or in part, upon notice.

YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT USE OF THE SERVICE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK AND IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES
OF TITLE OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE (EXCEPT ONLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED UNDER THE LAWS APPLICABLE TO TERMS OF USE WITH ANY
LEGALLY REQUIRED WARRANTY PERIOD TO THE SHORTER OF THIRTY DAYS FROM FIRST USE OR THE MINIMUM PERIOD

ANY OF THEIR DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, ATTORNEYS, THIRD-PARTY CONTENT PROVIDERS, DISTRIBUTORS,
LICENSEES OR LICENSORS (COLLECTIVELY, "CHILLTIME PARTIES") WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE DISCLAIMERS OF LIABILITY CONTAINED HEREIN APPLY TO ANY
AND ALL DAMAGES OR INJURY WHATSOEVER CAUSED BY OR RELATED TO USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE
SERVICE UNDER ANY CAUSE OR ACTION WHATSOEVER OF ANY JURISDICTION, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,

CHILLTIME PARTIES LIABLE, FOR THE CONDUCT OF THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING OTHER USERS OF THE SERVICE AND
OPERATORS OF EXTERNAL SITES, AND THAT THE RISK OF THE SERVICE AND EXTERNAL SITES AND OF INJURY FROM
THE FOREGOING RESTS ENTIRELY WITH YOU.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL THE CHILLTIME PARTIES BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR MORE THAN THE AMOUNT YOU HAVE
PAID CHILLTIME IN THE NINETY (90) DAYS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DATE ON WHICH YOU FIRST ASSERT ANY
SUCH CLAIM.

## 11. Indemnification

You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Chilltime Parties from and against all claims
and expenses, including attorneys' fees and costs, arising out of your use of the Service and/or
your breach or alleged breach of any term, condition, obligation, representation or warranty in
these Terms. You agree that the provisions in this paragraph will survive any termination of your
account(s) or the Service.

## 12. Governing Law/Waiver of Injunctive Relief

This Agreement and all aspects of the Service shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the internal laws of the Portugal and the Lisbon governing contracts entered into and to be fully
performed in Lisbon (i.e., without regard to conflict of laws provisions) regardless of your
location. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to informal dispute resolution or
arbitration (as set forth below), you agree not to commence or prosecute any action in connection
therewith other than in the state and federal courts located in Lisbon, Portugal, and you hereby
consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens with
respect to, venue and jurisdiction in the state and federal courts located in Lisbon.

You acknowledge that the rights granted and obligations made hereunder to Chilltime are of a unique
and irreplaceable nature, the loss of which shall irreparably harm Chilltime and which cannot be
replaced by monetary damages alone so that Chilltime shall be entitled to injunctive or other
equitable relief (without the obligations of posting any bond or surety) in the event of any breach
or anticipatory breach by you. You irrevocably waive all rights to seek injunctive or other
equitable relief and agree to limit your claims to claims for monetary damages (if any).

### 12.1. Informal Negotiations

To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy or claim related to this
Terms ("Dispute"), you and Chilltime agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those
Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating any
arbitration or court proceeding. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one
person to the other. You will send your notice to Chilltime Lda, <info@chilltime.com> ATTENTION:
LEGAL DEPARTMENT.

### 12.2. Binding Arbitration

If you and Chilltime are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, either you or
Chilltime may elect to have the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) finally and
exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final
and binding on the other. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE
IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the
Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and, where appropriate,
the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of
which are available at the AAA website <www.adr.org>. The determination of whether a Dispute is
subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by a court
rather than an arbitrator. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be
governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. If such costs
are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, Chilltime will pay all arbitration fees and
expenses. The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone
or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of
reasons unless requested by a party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be
challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you and
Chilltime may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to
confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.

### 12.3. Restrictions

You and Chilltime agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between Chilltime and
you individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any
other; (2) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis
or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be
brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.

### 12.4. Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration

You and Chilltime agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions
concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (1) any Disputes seeking to enforce or
protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or Chilltime’s intellectual property rights; (2)
any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy or
unauthorized use; and (3) any claim for injunctive relief.

## 13. Waiver/Severability

The failure of Chilltime to require or enforce strict performance by you of any provision of these
Terms or to exercise any right under them shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment of
Chilltime's right to assert or rely upon any such provision or right in that or any other instance.

You and Chilltime agree that if any portion of these Terms, except any portion of section 12(e), is
found illegal or unenforceable, in whole or in part by any court of competent jurisdiction, such
provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such determination of
invalidity or unenforceability without affecting the validity or enforceability thereof in any other
manner or jurisdiction and without affecting the remaining provisions of the Terms, which shall
continue to be in full force and effect. If Section 12(e) is found to be illegal or unenforceable
then neither you nor Chilltime will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of
Section 12(e) found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of
competent jurisdiction within the District of Lisbon, Portugal, and you and Chilltime agree to
submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

## 14. Miscellaneous

Chilltime operates and controls World War Online from its offices in Portugal. Chilltime makes no
representation that the Game is appropriate or available in other locations. The information
provided on the Service is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in any
jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or
which would subject Chilltime to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country.
Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the Game from other locations do so on their own
initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local
laws are applicable. By downloading any software, you represent and warrant that you are not located
in, under the control of, or a national or resident of, any such country or on any such list.

The parties specifically disclaim application of the Convention on Contracts for the International
Sale of Goods. These Terms are effective until terminated by either party. You may terminate these
Terms by destroying all Service-related materials obtained from the Service, Chilltime or any other
web site or source. The privileges granted to you under these Terms will terminate immediately and
automatically without notice from Chilltime if, in our sole discretion, you fail to comply with any
term or provision of these Terms.

Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act to modify these Terms
to any party at any time without any notice to you. You may not assign these Terms without
Chilltime's prior written consent. These Terms contain the entire understanding of you and
Chilltime, and supersede all prior understandings of the parties hereto relating to the subject
matter hereof, and cannot be changed or modified by you except as posted on the Service by
Chilltime.

If any provision of these Terms is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the Terms will be deemed
curtailed to the extent necessary to make it legal and enforceable and will remain, as modified, in
full force and effect. No waiver by either party of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed
to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default. The section headings used herein
are for convenience only and shall not be given any legal import. Upon Chilltime's request, you will
furnish Chilltime any documentation, substantiation or releases necessary to verify your compliance
with these Terms. You agree that these Terms will not be construed against Chilltime by virtue of
having drafted them. You hereby waive any and all defenses you may have based on the electronic form
of these Terms and the lack of signing by the parties hereto to execute these Terms.

## 15. Statute of Limitations

You and Chilltime both agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or
cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Service, Terms or Privacy Policy must be
filed within ONE (1) YEAR after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.

## 16. Complaints or Notices

The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) provides recourse to copyright owners who believe that
their rights under the Copyright law of the European Union have been infringed by acts of third
parties over the Internet. If you believe that your copyrighted work has been copied without your
authorization and is available on or in this game in a way that may constitute copyright

    the copyright owner, its agent, or the law;
